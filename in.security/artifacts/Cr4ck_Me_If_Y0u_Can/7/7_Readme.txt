Generate a list of masks that could be used in a password attack based on the following password policy:

Minimum length: 8
Maximum length: 12
Complexity: Mixed alpha-numeric & special characters

Flag: The number of compliant policy masks generated (maybe the 'Password Analysis Cracking Kit' can help you here?)
